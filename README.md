# Slop-Block
Slop Block is a lightweight browser extension designed to detect and filter out low-effort, AI-generated content (often referred to as "slop") from your social media feeds. Built to combat the rising tide of synthetic posts, this tool helps you curate a more authentic browsing experience by identifying and hiding AI-generated text and images.
