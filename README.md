**Slop Block**
Reclaim your social media feed from AI-generated noise.

📖 About
Slop Block is a lightweight browser extension designed to detect and filter out low-effort, AI-generated content (often referred to as "slop") from your social media feeds. Built to combat the rising tide of synthetic posts, this tool helps you curate a more authentic browsing experience by identifying and hiding AI-generated text and images.

✨ Features
Active Filtering: Automatically detects and hides suspected AI-generated "slop" on supported social media platforms.

Visual Indicators: Option to flag synthetic content with a visual warning rather than hiding it entirely.

Clean UI/UX: A straightforward, non-intrusive popup menu to easily toggle the extension on and off.

Privacy First: Operates locally within your browser to analyze feed content without compromising your personal data.
